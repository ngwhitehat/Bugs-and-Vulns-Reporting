# Bugs-and-Vulns-Reporting
🐞Bug and vulnerability reporting is the process of identifying and reporting any issues or security vulnerabilities found in a software or system. This repo helps track this within our Cyber Ecosystem in Nigeria

This is usually done by users or security researchers who have discovered a problem that could potentially harm the system or its users.

The purpose of bug and vulnerability reporting is to help developers and system administrators to identify and fix the issue in order to prevent further damage or exploitation. It is an important part of maintaining the security and functionality of any software or system.
